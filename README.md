# Security Audit Report
## Core problems : 
### 1. Cookie Security

- **Issue**: The `authToken` cookie is missing the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags in the login route, which leaves it accessible to client-side scripts and vulnerable to interception over non-HTTPS connections.
- **Solution**: Update the cookie settings in your login route to include `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.

---

### 2. Environment Variable Exposure

- **Issue**: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database URLs, and Stripe Secret Key) is exposed to the client by using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes. This information should be server-only to avoid unintended exposure.
- **Solution**: Move any sensitive variables (such as API keys, database URLs, and secret keys) to server-only environment variables, without `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in their names. Only non-sensitive data should be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` if it’s necessary for client-side use.

---

### 3. Database URL Exposure

- **Issue**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL` includes credentials directly, which can lead to accidental exposure or guessing attacks.
- **Solution**: Ensure the database URL is stored securely and used only in server-side code, avoiding exposure to the client.

---

### 4. Potential for XSS Vulnerabilities

- **Issue**: User input and API data displayed in components (e.g., `food-logs/page.js` and `useProfileData.js`) may be rendered without sanitization, which risks cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Solution**: Sanitize any data displayed from user input or external sources. For text-based outputs, use libraries like `DOMPurify` to remove potentially dangerous content, especially when rendering HTML.

---

### 5. Missing Security Headers

- **Issue**: Important security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options are not configured. These headers help prevent XSS, protocol downgrades, and MIME-type sniffing.
- **Solution**: Add middleware in your application to set essential security headers. Here’s an example configuration:
  ```javascript
  export function middleware(req, res, next) {
    res.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self';");
    res.setHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload");
    res.setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
    next();
  }
  ```

## Additionals problems : 

### 1. Weak Secrets

- **Issue**: Hardcoded tokens, passwords, or API keys may lack complexity and robustness.
- **Solution**: Review and enhance the strength of any hardcoded secrets, ensuring they follow best practices (sufficient length, randomness).

---

### 2. Rate Limiting and Brute-force Protection

- **Issue**: Without rate limiting, endpoints like login are susceptible to automated brute-force attacks.
- **Solution**: Implement rate limiting or brute-force protection on login endpoints using rate-limiting middleware or a service like Cloudflare.

---

### 3. Improper Error Handling

- **Issue**: Revealing too much information in error messages can aid attackers (e.g., distinguishing between incorrect usernames and passwords).
- **Solution**: Standardize error messages to avoid revealing specific information. Use generic messages like "Invalid credentials."

---

### 4. HTTP Methods

- **Issue**: Allowing unnecessary HTTP methods (like PUT or DELETE) expands the attack surface.
- **Solution**: Restrict endpoints to only the necessary HTTP methods (e.g., GET and POST).

---

### 5. CORS Misconfiguration

- **Issue**: CORS may allow unauthorized domains to make requests to your API.
- **Solution**: Restrict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to trusted origins to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### 6. Package Dependencies

- **Issue**: Outdated packages may have known vulnerabilities.
- **Solution**: Regularly audit third-party libraries and dependencies for security flaws. Use tools like `npm audit` to manage dependency security for Node.js projects.

---

### 7. Session Expiry

- **Issue**: Authentication tokens may not have appropriate expiration settings, increasing the risk of unauthorized session reuse.
- **Solution**: Set reasonable expiration times for authentication tokens and invalidate them upon logout to enhance security.

---

### 8. Database Access Control

- **Issue**: Overly privileged database accounts increase the potential impact of a breach.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the database user has only the minimal permissions required to perform its functions.

This document outlines the primary security concerns identified in the audit, along with suggested actions to mitigate each issue. Addressing these will significantly enhance the security posture of the application.
